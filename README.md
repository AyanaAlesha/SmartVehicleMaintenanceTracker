Smart Vehicle Maintenance Tracker

Project Overview

The Smart Vehicle Maintenance Tracker is a console-based C# application designed to help users manage vehicle information and track maintenance activities such as oil changes, tire rotations, and other service events. The application allows users to create vehicle profiles, log maintenance records, retrieve service history, and update or delete records as needed. Data persistence is handled using a SQLite database, ensuring that information is retained between program executions.

This project was developed as a cumulative demonstration of advanced object-oriented programming concepts, data persistence, and clean application design. The system reflects a real-world problem and provides a professional-quality example suitable for inclusion in a programming portfolio.
## Features
- Create and manage vehicle profiles
- Log vehicle maintenance records
- View complete maintenance history per vehicle
- Update and delete existing records
- Persistent data storage using SQLite
- Menu-driven console interface
- Clean, modular, and extensible codebase

## Object-Oriented Programming Concepts Demonstrated
- **Abstraction** – Base classes define shared behavior
- **Inheritance** – Specialized classes extend base functionality
- **Polymorphism** – Base-type references invoke overridden methods
- **Composition** – Vehicles contain collections of maintenance records
- **Encapsulation** – Access specifiers protect internal data
- **Constructors** – Ensure valid object initialization
